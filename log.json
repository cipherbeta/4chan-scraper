They used this frequency to send live pictures back from the moon and much more. I was under the impression the higher the frequency the shorter it can travel but the more data you can send? I just find this fascinating because lots of routers operate at 2.4GHz and can barely supply reliable WiFi a couple meters away in the next room! It seems like airports also may use the S-Band for Radar very interesting but I can't find anything on how the range is extended."

I'm planning on buying the cheapest Kindle model (I don't read nearly as much to consider a Paperwhite let alone an Oasis), 'cuz I've heard it is worth it. But I've got a small library of e-books I plan to read already and they are in epub djvu and pdf format, will Kindle give me a hard time for that? And, does anybody know of a site where I can legally buy DRM-free e-books? I'd rather avoid the hassle of having to de-DRM and store that copy on my hard drive every time I buy a book from Amazon."
